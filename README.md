We used a multiview-learning for regression that exploits word embedding models and linguistic resource (word length, frequency lists,
lexical databases composed of school dictionaries). We use it to infer four psycholinguistic properties of words:

* Concreteness;
* Subjective Frequency;
* Imageability;
* AoA

This work is adaption to [Inferring Psycholinguistic Properties of Words](http://anthology.aclweb.org/N/N16/N16-1050.pdf) (Paetzold and Specia; 2016) for portuguese language.
